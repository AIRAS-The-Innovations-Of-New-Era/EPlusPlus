# Generator expression examples
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Generator expression (similar to list comprehension but generates items on-demand)
squared_gen = (x * x for x in numbers)

# Generator expression with condition
even_gen = (x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0)
print(list(even_gen))

# Generator expression used with sum()
sum_of_squares = sum(x * x for x in range(10))
print(sum_of_squares)

# Generator expression used with max()
max_square = max(x * x for x in range(1, 6))
