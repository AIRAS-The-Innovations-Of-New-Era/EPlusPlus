# E++

A Python-compatible compiled language â€” readable like Python, powerful like C++, and built for native performance.

## Project Goal

To create a fully Python-compatible language that:
- Uses Python 3.x syntax (ideally 100% compatible)
- Compiles `.eppx` files into native binaries
- Does not depend on CPython at runtime
- Can run standard Python libraries and modules
- Uses a modern systems language as the backend (Rust or C++)
- Supports a custom IR, compiler, runtime, and package manager

See `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` and the project roadmap for more details.
